19-11-2017: Email or password are sent with the edit request
to /user/update-profile, even if the user doesn't click to show
the input fields. Probably because of browser saved values.
A clear() function is used in views/user/profile.ejs, to remove
any browser stored data. It's not working.

-> To be fixed by changing the name of html input names.
-- Done
